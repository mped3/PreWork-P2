        <h3><a href="https://perscholas.org/"> Greetings Per Scholas Team</a></h3>
        <p>I started making music in 2020, the pandemic left me with nothing but time and creativity. I created my first beat on garageband very simple with only about 4 different instruments. Three years later, I can say I have grown as a music producer. Not only do I create beats now, but I've actually gotteb into writing music and basic engineering. I hope to someday become one of the greatest and make a song with my favorite artist NAS.</p>

<p id="photo">I started photography in 2016 and from there I couldn't get enough of art. I took an art fundamentals class as well, where I had to draw a portrait of myslef. It was complex and took alot of time, but my teacher was very patient, and showed me a trick to capturing each individual element.</p>
